Hi, I'm John Tobin, a Unix Systems Administrator in the [School of Computer
Science and Statistics](http://www.scss.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/).  My responsibilities include:

* mail server: SMTP, anti-spam and anti-virus measures, mailing lists, POP, IMAP, webmail
* web server
* proxies: HTTP, SOCKS, CVS, NAT
* backups for Linux and Solaris servers
* IPv6
* NTP, DNS, and DHCP
* support for users
* a lab running Linux for students' use
* most other services running on Linux or Solaris servers

I'm (nearly) a double graduate of Trinity College: I completed a B.A. (Mod) in
Computer Science in 2002, and I recently finished an M.Sc. in Computer Science
(I'll graduate in 2010); my thesis and papers are available from
[[my_publications_page|publications]].  I studied for my M.Sc. in evenings and
weekends, in addition to my full-time job, and completed it in two years, the
minimum time period permitted.
