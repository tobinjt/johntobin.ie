Hi, I'm John Tobin.

Since July 2010 I've been working in Site Reliability Engineering at
[Google](http://www.google.ie/intl/en/about.html).  Currently I'm the manager of
[BigTable](http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html) SRE in Dublin;
previously I was an SRE running BigTable, Colossus, and
[GFS](http://research.google.com/archive/gfs.html).

I'm a double graduate of [Trinity College, Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/): I
completed a B.A. (Mod) in Computer Science in 2002, and an M.Sc. in Computer
Science in 2009; my M.Sc. thesis and papers are available from
[[my_publications_page|publications]].  I studied for my M.Sc. in evenings and
weekends, in addition to my full-time job, and completed it in two years, the
minimum time period permitted.

For seven years I was a Unix Systems Administrator in the [School of Computer
Science and Statistics](http://www.scss.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/).

For four years I was a Unix Systems Administrator for the [Internet
Society](http://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/).
