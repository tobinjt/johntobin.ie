Hi, I'm John Tobin.  For seven years I was a Unix Systems Administrator in the
[School of Computer Science and Statistics](http://www.scss.tcd.ie/), [Trinity
College Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/).  My responsibilities included:

* mail server: SMTP, anti-spam and anti-virus measures, mailing lists, POP, IMAP, webmail
* web server
* proxies: HTTP, SOCKS, CVS, NAT
* backups for Linux and Solaris servers
* IPv6
* NTP, DNS, and DHCP
* support for users
* a lab running Linux for students' use
* most other services running on Linux or Solaris servers

I'm a double graduate of Trinity College: I completed a B.A. (Mod) in Computer
Science in 2002, and an M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2009; my thesis and papers
are available from [[my_publications_page|publications]].  I studied for my
M.Sc. in evenings and weekends, in addition to my full-time job, and completed
it in two years, the minimum time period permitted.

From July 2010 I will be working as a Site Reliability Engineer for
[Google](http://www.google.ie/intl/en/about.html).
