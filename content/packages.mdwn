All packages are built for [Debian
Lenny](http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/), but will probably build without a
problem on other [Debian releases](http://www.debian.org/releases/),
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), or other Debian-derived distributions; if you
have any problems, I'm happy to accept bug reports and or patches (see
[[contact_details]]).  The packaging is licenced under the terms of the [GNU
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html); this does not
change the terms of the original software licence.
