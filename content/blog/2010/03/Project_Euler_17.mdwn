[The seventeenth Project Euler
problem:](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=17)

> If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
> then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
>
> If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in
> words, how many letters would be used?
>
> NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and
> forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20
> letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with
> British usage.

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-17-1 ()
      (labels ((count-letters (list-of-words)
                              (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'length list-of-words))))
        (let* ((num-decades         8)
               (num-hundreds        9)
               (num-hundred-ands    99)
               (sum-below-10        (count-letters '("one" "two" "three" "four" "five" "six" "seven" "eight" "nine")))
               (sum-teens           (count-letters '("ten" "eleven" "twelve" "thirteen" "fourteen" "fifteen" "sixteen" "seventeen" "eighteen" "nineteen")))
               (sum-decades         (count-letters '("twenty" "thirty" "forty" "fifty" "sixty" "seventy" "eighty" "ninety")))
               (sum-20-99           (+ (* sum-decades 10) (* sum-below-10 num-decades)))
               (sum-below-100       (+ sum-below-10 sum-teens sum-20-99))
               (sum-x-hundred-ands  (* num-hundred-ands (+ sum-below-10 (* num-hundreds (count-letters '("hundred" "and"))))))
               (sum-x-hundred       (+ sum-below-10 (* num-hundreds (count-letters '("hundred")))))
               (sum-100-999         (+ sum-x-hundred sum-x-hundred-ands (* num-hundreds sum-below-100)))
               (sum-1-1000          (+ (count-letters '("one" "thousand")) sum-below-100 sum-100-999)))
          sum-1-1000)))

This is a pretty simple problem, it's just tricky to get all the details
correct.
