> Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-20-1 ()
      (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (parse-integer (string x)))
                          (coerce (write-to-string (reduce #'* (loop for i from 1 to 100 collect i))) 'list))))

It's pretty dense code, but it's basically:

1. Calculate 100!
2. Write the answer to a string.
3. Convert each character in the string to a digit.
4. Sum the resulting digits.
