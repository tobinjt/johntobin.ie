[The sixteenth Project Euler
problem:](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=16)

> 2^(15) = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

> What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^(1000)?

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-16-1 ()
      (let ((number-string (write-to-string (expt 2 1000)))
            (sum-of-digits 0))
    
        (dotimes (i (length number-string) sum-of-digits)
          (setf sum-of-digits (+ sum-of-digits
                                 (parse-integer (string (char number-string i))))))))

This is very easy in LISP, and would be in any language that supports integers
large enough to calculate 2^1000.
