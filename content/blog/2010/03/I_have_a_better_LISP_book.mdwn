About a month ago I wrote that [[I need a better LISP
book|blog/2010/02/I_need_a_better_LISP_book/]].  I gave up on the LISP book I
had been reading, and started reading [On LISP: Advanced Techniques for Common
LISP](http://www.amazon.co.uk/LISP-Advanced-Techniques-Common/dp/0130305529/) by
Paul Graham.  I've read about one third of it, and understood most of it - I had
trouble with some of the more difficult code, but I understood his explanations
of LISP features and what the code was doing.  I was impressed enough to get a
copy of [ANSI Common
LISP](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ANSI-Common-Prentice-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0133708756/),
and I've read about one third of it in the last week.  It's **excellent** -
clear, concise, well structured; I highly recommend it.  I've started solving
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems again, and I'm much happier
with my code.
