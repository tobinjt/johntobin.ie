Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-45-1 ()
      ; Wikipedia tells us that all hexagonal nubers are triangle numbers, so we're
      ; looking for the first hexagonal number after H143 that's pentagonal.
      (do ((n 144 (1+ n)))
          ((pentagonal-number-p (hexagonal-number n)) (hexagonal-number n))))
    
    (defun hexagonal-number (a-number)
      "Calculates Hexagonal Number N."
      (* a-number (1- (* a-number 2))))
