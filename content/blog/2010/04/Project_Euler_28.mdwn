Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-28-1 ()
      (do ((total 1)
           (current 1)
           (increment 2 (+ 2 increment)))
          ((>= current (* 1001 1001)) total)
        ; Each time you travel round the square, total increases by:
        ;     current +  1 * increment
        ;     current +  2 * increment
        ;     current +  3 * increment
        ;     current +  4 * increment
        ; ---------------------
        ; 4 * current + 10 * increment
        ; current increases by 4 * increment
        (incf total   (+ (* 4 current) (* 10 increment)))
        (incf current (* 4 increment))))
