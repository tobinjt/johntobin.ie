problem 34:](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=34)

> 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
>
> Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of
> their digits.
>
> Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-34-1 ()
      (let ((curious-numbers '())
            (factorials (make-array 10)))
    
        (setf (aref factorials 0) 1)
        (loop for i from 1 to 9 do
          (setf (aref factorials i) (* (aref factorials (1- i)) i)))
    
        ; (* 6 9!) = 2177280
        ; (* 7 9!) = 2540160 - this is our limit
        ; (* 8 9!) = 2903040
        (loop for each-number from 3 to (* 7 (aref factorials 9)) do
          (let ((sum-of-factorials-of-digits 0))
            (do* ((remaining-digits each-number (floor remaining-digits 10))
                  (current-digit (mod remaining-digits 10) (mod remaining-digits 10)))
                 ((zerop remaining-digits))
              (incf sum-of-factorials-of-digits (aref factorials current-digit)))
            (when (= each-number sum-of-factorials-of-digits)
              (push each-number curious-numbers))))
        (reduce #'+ curious-numbers)))
