## Subassemblies

These models are far easier to paint if you apply the base paint before fully
assembling the models. Definitely keep all the backpacks off; also keep off any
arms that will be close to or blocking the body.

### Mounting

I mounted the subassemblies like this:

- Slice the cork from a wine bottle into 1cm sections.
- Glue each section onto a spare base (e.g. [Citadel 32mm Round
  Bases](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-32mm-Round-Bases)) using
  superglue; mounting on spare bases allows you to use your [painting
  handle](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Citadel-Colour-Painting-Handle-2020).
- Straighten out a paperclip and cut it into 3cm or 4cm sections - you need the
  subassembly to be far enough away from the painting handle that you can get
  the brush in at the underside.
- Drill one or preferably two holes in each piece somewhere they won't be seen
  when the model is assembled, e.g. the middle of the backpack, or the posts on
  the arms that plug into the body. Two holes means the subassembly won't rotate
  when you're painting it - this is very annoying when it happens :( The hole
  needs to be slightly bigger than the paperclip so that you can wiggle the
  paperclip around when taking the subassembly apart later. The Citadel drill is
  the right size if you can get hold of one.
- Put some superglue in **one** of the holes you drilled, push in a piece of
  paperclip, hold until set. I tried plastic glue and it didn't work at all - I
  needed to use superglue. Repeat with another paperclip piece and the second
  hole on that subassembly.
- Push the other end of the two paperclip sections into the cork on the spare
  base.
- Repeat until all the subassemblies are mounted.

Now you can easily paint your subassemblies.

### Prepare for priming

Before priming I covered the peg holes with bluetac and covered the pegs with
masking tape. I don't know if this was necessary but I wasn't taking any
chances :) I left the bluetac and masking tape on until I finished applying the
base coat, which was a mistake - the masking tape came off easily but the
bluetac took a really long time to clean off, so I would clean that off
immediately after priming in future.

### Unmounting

To unmount the subassemblies I gently wiggled the paperclip sections around
until they loosened enough to pull out. Only one paperclip section took much
effort - the other paperclip sections came off within 5-10 seconds. If the
paperclip section that was hard to remove had taken much longer I probably would
have cut it just above the surface of the model; I am concerned that if I had
done that the paperclip might have protruded and prevented the piece from
sitting properly :(

## Undercoat

- Death Guard Green primer

## Base coat

Apply in roughly this order:

- Armour: Death Guard Green (already done with the undercoat)
- Silver parts: Leadbelcher
- Metal trim: Balthasar Gold; there are small gold pieces on top of the
  chainmail, so do gold after silver.
- Cloaks and loincloths: Screamer Pink
- Tentacles: Screamer Pink
- Bone, skulls, big Nurgle teeth, and horns: Ushabti Bone; will need 3+ coats
  for full coverage; (videos use Wraithbone)
- Boils: Averland Sunset (Flesh/Boils in app)
- Slime: Castellan Green
- Melee weapon handles: Mournfang Brown
- Armour Joints:
  - I used Abaddon Black, but I would most likely use Corvus Black in future
  - Don't layer on too heavily, a lighter coat is better
- Hoses: Abaddon Black
- Pipes: Leadbelcher or Screamer Pink depending on location
- Brown-ish flesh (e.g. bare head): Bugman's Glow (Inflamed Flesh in Citadel
  Paint App)
- Worms: Yriel Yellow or Averland Sunset

## Shade

I recommend fully assembling the model before shading so the shade is more
consistent across the model. It will be hard to highlight some spots, but those
spots will be harder to see, so it's less of a problem.

- Agrax Earthshade nearly all over - avoid flesh, boils, and any other places
  that get a different shade.
- Brown-ish flesh:
  - Carroburg Crimson; probably need several coats
  - Shade a smaller area with Druchii Violet - I applied several light
    layers around the mouth to make it stand out from the rest of the head
- Boils: Reikland Fleshshade; probably need several coats; heavier in the
  recesses.

## Highlight

- Armour:
  - Dry brush with Elysian Green
  - Do this immediately after shading because it's messy and will splatter other
    parts of the miniature
  - Try your best not to hit other colours, but you'll be highlighting most of
    the areas you damage anyway, so it's not too bad
- Cloaks and loincloths:
  - Screamer Pink everywhere except the recesses; see [How to Paint: Lord of
    Contagion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=512&v=29Yg2ukwpTo) (timestamped)
- Brass: Sycorax Bronze
- Leadbelcher: Ironbreaker, because it's not as bright as Stormhost Silver
- Black: Dark Reaper on the raised parts
- Tentacles/Screamer Pink: Screamer Pink; this will be very organic and the
  shape of the tentacle will influence it
- Bone, skulls, big Nurgle teeth, and horns: Ushabti Bone
  - I found the horns were hard to get right and were a very organic process; I
    ended up covering a **lot** of the horns, I left the recesses and the lower
  part of the horn shaded and layered most of the rest
  - Edge highlight: eye sockets, teeth, edges and tips of horns
- Boils:
  - Averland Sunset over most of the boil, keep it out of the recesses
  - Try not to make it clearly defined - aim for more natural and uneven
  - Apply two or three (depending on the size of the boil) successively smaller
    coats so it builds in intensity in the centre
- Slime:
  - Castellan Green
  - Several coats of Nurgle's Rot, with more on the areas where slime would be
    collecting e.g. the bottom of a ball of slime
- Mournfang Brown: layer with Mournfang Brown
- Brown-ish flesh: layer with Kislev Flesh
- Worms: Yriel Yellow or Averland Sunset; I found it was hard to only hit the
  raised parts

## Extreme highlight

- Armour: edge highlight with Ogryn Camo
- Cloaks and loincloths: Pink Horror on the raised details - edges and creases
- Brass: maybe touches of Nihilakh Oxide? I didn't use this, but it might be
  nice
- Tentacles/Screamer Pink: Pink Horror on tips of tentacles
- Bone, skulls, and horns: Screaming Skull on tips of horns
- Big Nurgle teeth: Blood for the Blood God on some of the teeth
- Boils: Ushabti Bone on the centre of the bigger ones, should look like they
  are about to burst

## Base

- Fenrisian Grey on the rim and where there will be snow. I needed at least
  3, probably 5 coats for full coverage; maybe starting with a layer of
  Celestra Grey or The Fang would have been easier?
- Castellan Green around the feet and for tracks behind the model where the
  feet would have moved and the snow destroyed
- Two or three layers of Nurgle's Rot on the Castellan Green
- Valhallan Blizzard over the Fenrisian Grey; this should be the very last
  thing done because any splashes from the model will really show up on the
  white

## Details

- Eyes: Yriel Yellow or Averland Sunset or Screamer Pink
- Weathering:
  - Maybe Nihilakh Oxide?
  - Snow doesn't really lend itself to weathering in this case, because the
    Death Guard are destroying the snow as they pass, so it wouldn't make
    sense for snow to be sticking to them
- Chipping and battle damage? I didn't do any, maybe in the future?
