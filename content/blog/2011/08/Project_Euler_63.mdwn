We can divide the positive integers into three groups:

* x == 10: 10^n is always an n+1 digit number.
* x  > 10: x^n is at least an n+1 digit number, and when n is high enough it
           will be an n+2 digit number.  E.g. 11^24 is a 25 digit number,
           but 11^25 is a 27 digit number.
* x  < 10: x^n is at most an n digit number, and when n is high enough it will
           be an n-1 digit number.  E.g. 9^21 is a 21 digit number, but 9^22
           is also a 21 digit number.

So we're only interested in the positive intergers < 10, and once x^n has
fewer than n digits, we don't need to check x^n+1 or higher.

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-63-1 ()
      (let ((result 0))
        (dofromto (1 9 x result)
          (do* ((n 1 (1+ n))
                (x^n (expt x n) (expt x n))
                (num-digits-in-x^n (length (number-to-digits x^n))
                                   (length (number-to-digits x^n))))
               ((< num-digits-in-x^n n))
            (incf result)))))
