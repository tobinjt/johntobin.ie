Diagonals are given by:

    1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
      + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4
      + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6
      + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8
      . . .

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-58-1 ()
      (do ((num-primes 0)
           (num-diagonals 1)
           (index 1)
           (increment 2 (+ 2 increment)))
          ((and (not (zerop num-primes))
                (< (/ num-primes num-diagonals) 0.1))
           (1- increment))
        (dofromto (1 4 i)
          (incf index increment)
          (incf num-diagonals)
          ; The fourth corner is always a square, so cannot be a prime.
          (when (and (not (= 4 i))
                     (primep index))
            (incf num-primes)))))
