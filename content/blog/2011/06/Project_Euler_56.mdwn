[Project Euler problem

> A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
> 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
> Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Here's my LISP solution:

    (defun project-euler-56-1 ()
      (let ((highest-sum 0))
        (dofromto (1 99 a highest-sum)
          (let ((a^b a))
            (dofromto (2 99 b)
              (setf a^b (* a^b a))
              (setf highest-sum (max highest-sum
                                     (apply #'+ (number-to-digits a^b)))))))))
