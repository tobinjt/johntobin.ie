About a month ago I wrote that [I need a better LISP
book](/blog/i_need_a_better_lisp_book/).  I gave up on the LISP book I had been
reading, and started reading [On LISP: Advanced Techniques for Common
LISP](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LISP-Advanced-Techniques-Common/dp/0130305529/)
by Paul Graham.  I've read about one third of it, and understood most of it - I
had trouble with some of the more difficult code, but I understood his
explanations of LISP features and what the code was doing.  I was impressed
enough to get a copy of [ANSI Common
LISP](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ANSI-Common-Prentice-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0133708756/),
and I've read about one third of it in the last week.  It's **excellent** -
clear, concise, well structured; I highly recommend it.  I've started solving
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems again, and I'm much happier
with my code.
