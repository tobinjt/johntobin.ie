Hi, I'm John Tobin.

Since July 2010 I've been working in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at
[Google](https://about.google/). Currently I'm the manager of
[Bigtable](https://research.google/pubs/bigtable-a-distributed-storage-system-for-structured-data/)
SRE in Dublin; previously I was an SRE running Bigtable,
[Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system),
and [GFS](https://research.google/pubs/the-google-file-system/).

I'm a double graduate of [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/): I
completed a B.A. (Mod) in Computer Science in 2002, and an M.Sc. in Computer
Science in 2009; my M.Sc. thesis and papers are available from [my publications
page](/publications/). I studied for my M.Sc. in evenings and weekends, in
addition to my full-time job, and completed it in two years, the minimum time
period permitted.

For seven years I was a Unix Systems Administrator in the [School of Computer
Science and Statistics](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/), [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).

For four years I was a Unix Systems Administrator for the [Internet
Society](https://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).
