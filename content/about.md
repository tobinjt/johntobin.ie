Hi, I'm John Tobin.

Since July 2010 I've been working in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at
[Google](https://www.google.ie/intl/en/about.html). Currently I'm the manager
of [Bigtable](https://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html) SRE in Dublin;
previously I was an SRE running Bigtable,
[Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system),
and [GFS](https://research.google.com/archive/gfs.html).

I'm a double graduate of [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/): I
completed a B.A. (Mod) in Computer Science in 2002, and an M.Sc. in Computer
Science in 2009; my M.Sc. thesis and papers are available from
[my publications page](/publications/). I studied for my M.Sc. in evenings and
weekends, in addition to my full-time job, and completed it in two years, the
minimum time period permitted.

For seven years I was a Unix Systems Administrator in the [School of Computer
Science and Statistics](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).

For four years I was a Unix Systems Administrator for the [Internet
Society](https://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/), [Trinity College
Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).
