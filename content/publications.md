### 2008

- [A User-Extensible and Adaptable Parser Architecture](/publications/sgai-2008.pdf),
  published in the [SGAI 2008 Conference](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/ai2008/), and
  selected as one of the best papers from the conference. I was subsequently
  asked to join the
  [Technical Stream Program Committee](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/tpc/?x=491), and
  I accepted the invitation.

- The [best papers](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/sgai/kbsj_ai2008.htm) from the
  [SGAI 2008 Conference](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/ai2008/) were reprinted in a
  [special edition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/knowledge-based-systems/vol/22/issue/7)
  of the
  [Knowledge-Based Systems Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/knowledge-based-systems),
  including
  [a slightly modified version of A User-Extensible and Adaptable Parser Architecture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705109000094)
  (the modifications were solely to meet the publisher's formatting
  requirements; the contents are unchanged from
  [the original paper](/publications/sgai-2008.pdf)).

### 2009

- My M.Sc. thesis,
  [Parsing Log Files Produced by the Postfix Mail Transfer Agent](/publications/msc-thesis.pdf),
  describes the parser architecture I designed to parse log files produced by
  [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/); it also describes the program I
  implemented based on that architecture, which parses Postfix log files,
  extracts as much data as possible, normalises it, and stores it in a database
  for subsequent analysis; it concludes by evaluating the program on the
  criteria of efficiency and correctness. Future work will use the database
  populated by the program to optimise existing anti-spam measures, test and
  evaluate new anti-spam measures, and identify operational and performance
  problems.

### 2016

- [Interrupt Reduction Projects](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/winter2016/beyer),
  co-authored by Betsy Beyer, John Tobin, and Liz Fong-Jones.

  > Interrupts are a fact of life for any team that’s responsible for
  > maintaining a service or software. However, this type of work doesn’t have
  > to be a constant drain on your team’s bandwidth or resources. This article
  > begins by describing the landscape of work faced by Site Reliability
  > Engineering (SRE) teams at Google: the types of work we undertake, the
  > logistics of how SRE teams are organized across sites, and the inevitable
  > toil we incur. Within this discussion, we focus on interrupts: how teams
  > initially approached tickets, and why and how we implemented a better
  > strategy. After providing a case study of how the ticket funnel was one such
  > successful initiative, we offer practical advice about mapping what we
  > learned to other organizations.
