### 2008

*   [A User-Extensible and Adaptable Parser
    Architecture](/publications/sgai-2008.pdf), published in the [SGAI 2008
    Conference](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/ai2008/), and selected as one of the
    best papers from the conference.  I was subsequently asked to join the
    [Technical Stream Program Committee](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/tpc/?x=491),
    and I accepted the invitation.

*   The [best papers](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/sgai/kbsj_ai2008.htm) from the
    [SGAI 2008 Conference](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/ai2008/) were reprinted in a
    [special
    edition](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&_tockey=%23TOC%235652%232009%23999779992%231492106%23FLA%23&_cdi=5652&_pubType=J&_auth=y&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c8b5b4f07319ac01a00136db989ce839)
    of the [Knowledge-Based Systems
    Journal](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/525448/description),
    including [a slightly modified version of A User-Extensible and Adaptable
    Parser
    Architecture](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V0P-4VDH8TX-2&_user=10&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&_rdoc=7&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%235652%232009%23999779992%231492106%23FLA%23display%23Volume%29&_cdi=5652&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=13&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=5c31a86b511324c294ed5ef10d775f85)
    (the modifications were solely to meet the publisher's formatting
    requirements; the contents are unchanged from [the original
    paper](/publications/sgai-2008.pdf)).

### 2009

*   My M.Sc. thesis, [Parsing Log Files Produced by the Postfix Mail Transfer
    Agent](/pubications/msc-thesis.pdf), describes the parser architecture I
    designed to parse log files produced by [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/);
    it also describes the program I implemented based on that architecture,
    which parses Postfix log files, extracts as much data as possible,
    normalises it, and stores it in a database for subsequent analysis; it
    concludes by evaluating the program on the criteria of efficiency and
    correctness.  Future work will use the database populated by the program to
    optimise existing anti-spam measures, test and evaluate new anti-spam
    measures, and identify operational and performance problems.

### 2016

*   [Interrupt Reduction
    Projects](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/winter-2016-vol-41-no-4/beyer),
    co-authored by Betsy Beyer, John Tobin, and Liz Fong-Jones.

    > Engineering (SRE) teams at Google: the types of work we undertake, the
    > logistics of how SRE teams are organized across sites, and the inevitable
    > toil we incur. Within this discussion, we focus on interrupts: how teams
    > initially approached tickets, and why and how we implemented a better
    > strategy. After providing a case study of how the ticket funnel was one
    > such successful initiative, we offer practical advice about mapping what
    > we learned to other organizations.
